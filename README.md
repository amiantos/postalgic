Postalgic is a blogging platform for your pocket. Simply put, it's 1999's Blogger in app form, fully decentralized. In the parlance of our times, it's an all-in-one blog-oriented content management system and static site generator & publisher.

## Postalgic is not a social network.

Online social networks have proven themselves incapable of nuturing meaningful human relationships.

- If you want to "follow" another Postalgic blog, you should subscribe to it in your RSS feed reader.
- If you want to "comment" on someone else's writing, start your own Postalgic blog and write a post about it.
- If you want to "private message" another Postalgic author, send them an email (if they've provided one).
- If you want to "like" a blog post you enjoyed, share it with your friends and family.
