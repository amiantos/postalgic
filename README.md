Postalgic is a pocket-sized decentralized micro-blogging platform. Simply put, it's a bit like 1999's Blogger, but fully decentralized... and then re-centralized into your pocket. In the parlance of our times, it's an all-in-one webblog CMS and static site generator with remote publishing built in.

## Postalgic is not a "social network".

Online "social networks" have proven themselves incapable of nuturing meaningful human relationships. We do not need them.

- If you want to "follow" or "subscribe" to another Postalgic blog, add it to your RSS feed reader.
- If you want to "comment" on someone else's post, start your own weblog and write a post about it.
- If you want to "dm" or "friend" another Postalgic author, send them an email (if they've provided one).
- If you want to "like" a blog post you enjoyed, share it with your friends, family, and coworkers.
